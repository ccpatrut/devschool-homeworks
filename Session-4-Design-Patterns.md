Emily's pizza store wants a new application able to help them manage their orders. 
The store has 5 kinds of different pizzas with different particularities. You can get inspired from here: https://www.webstaurantstore.com/article/101/types-of-pizza.html 
In the new application a customer service should be able to:
    -> Place orders taken by phone to backers (cheffs, backoffice, whatever..)
    -> Be notified when a new order is ready to be delivered
    -> Allow users to chose from 3 different kinds of extras on their pizzas.
    
In your implementation the following design patterns are required:
. Singleton
. Builder
. Factory
. Strategy
. Observer


You are allowed not to use one of the required design patterns with one condition: replace it with some other that you like and we didn't cover.

Furthermore, since you might be a design pattern addict, you can add one extra. One that you like the most and suits to this case. 

In conclusion your implementation should have at least 5 design patterns and a maximum of 6 from which 4 should be the required ones.

Good luck! :)
